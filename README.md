description: "Welcome to the r/HomeKitAutomation wiki!"

This is our Wiki. May we all gain and gleam from its knowledge.

Let's begin the automation journey!
Here is a compendium of info to get you started as well as some helpful termanology and some resources. We also have an FAQ should you need to view it.
If you would like to contribute guides and resources, feel free to let me know on our discord, or via our subreddit. guides will need to be .txt documents or pastebins.
