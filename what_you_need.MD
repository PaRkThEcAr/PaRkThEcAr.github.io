What do you need to automate with HomeKit?
Simple!
You need a HomeKit hub! Apple has a page dedicated just to this. You need at least one AppleTV 4th generation or later, a HomePod or HomePod Mini, or an iPad plugged into power with the setting enabled under Settings -> Home -> Use this iPad as a Home Hub
You need HomeKit devices. This can be achieved with either native devices (like Hue light bulbs) or bridged accessories with r/homebridge https://www.scrypted.app/ or r/homeassistant.
An iPhone, iPad, or Mac (running Mojave or later) to edit and create automations. You need an iOS device to make these automations.
