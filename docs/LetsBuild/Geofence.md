## If you get out of my house I will lock it behind you... or not. The computer will :)

Geofenced automations are placed into 2 (technically 3) categories. To be able to use these, users need to have an iOS/iPadOS device (preferably an iPhone) that is set as your location device in iCloud "share my location" preferences. An iPad or iPod Touch could be used, but the accuracy and viability isnt as great compared to an iPhone which is in your pocket, has cellular, and carries GPS. they also need to be members of your home.
1. When anyone leaves, or when the last person leaves.
2. When anyone arrives, or when the first person arrives.
3. When anyone leaves/arrives at X location (this will be talked about in advanced automations)

Any of these categories can be mixed with multiple users. For example:

- When PaRkThEcAr or Mimi leave/arrive home (PaRkThEcAr and Mimi checked)
- When the last/first of Mimi and Bo leave/arrive home (Mimi and Bo checked)
- When Bo leave/arrives home (ONLY Bo chekced)
- When anyone leave/arrives home (all users checked)

These all hold true for a location that isn't a home by the way (like Work). You can also condition them between similar time schedules to the time trigger time (after X time or at night/during day)
