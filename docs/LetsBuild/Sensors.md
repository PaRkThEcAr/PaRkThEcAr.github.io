## Now the real fun begins

Sensors are a simple way to control things. they contain MANY variables and a chart will be included in the wiki that goes over the triggers for specific kinds of sensors. they are in two categories. Binary, and non-binary (environmental) for binary you have:
- Motion
- Occupancy
- Contact
- Alarm
- Leak

For non-binary:
- Air quality (TVOC)
- Temperature
- Light
Some of these can combine elements of binary and non-binary types. So keep an eye out! some use cases.

Motion/occupancy: when X sensor detects motion, turn on Y lights

Contact: when X contact sensor detects contact (door close) lock X door.

Alarm: when Alarm is triggered, set all lights to 100%, white, and unlock the door (more on this later)

Air Quality: when air quality lowers below fair, turn on Fan
Temp: when X temp sensor raises above 23 degrees Celsius, turn on the Fan.
