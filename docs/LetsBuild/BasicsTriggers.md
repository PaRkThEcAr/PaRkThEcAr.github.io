## Not because ya basic. But because we all need to start somewhere. Here are the triggers!
---

In HomeKit, you have MANY trigger types. these fall into a few categories.

![jtd](https://github.com/PaRkThEcAr/PaRkThEcAr.github.io/blob/main/docs/LetsBuild/Images/TriggerTypesStock.png?raw=true)

Starting from the top, you effectively have 4 categories.

1. Geofenced (when people leave/arrive a location)
2. A time of day (5:00, at sunrise/sunset, 15 minutes after sunset)
3. An accessory is controlled (X light turns on, Garage opens)
4. Sensor detects something (motion/occupancy/TVoC/etc.)
5. Button press (this is just does an action when button is pressed nothing SUPER fancy here)

For all automation types to show up, you need to have an accessory that fills that category. we will cover more in the next section as we dive into each type.

All automations also have conditions. We will talk conditions in a bit.
