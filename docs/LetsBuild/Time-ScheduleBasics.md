You can schedule it for a time of day (ex. at 5 AM) or on a circadian (sunrise sunset) schedule. with circadian, you can add an additional stipulation (by hitting the (i) on the right) to offset it (15 minutes before sunrise, 1 hour after sunset)
You can also condition it to happen on specific days. in this example, its set to go on every day. but you could for example, run it on Monday every week, or on Saturday and Sunday weekly. any combination of these is acceptable.
