Just like in our last section, using these HomeKit apps we can choose LOTS of stuff for conditioning... in fact, far more than you would think. yes, you do have your presence, weekday, circadian, and ToD conditions. but you also have accessory (sensors included) conditioning which gets the same full set of traits that triggers do :) even better though, you can COMBINE them.

even better, you can set them to an ALL or ONE rule. meaning, either ALL conditions need to be met, or only ONE condition needs to be met. this can be hepful for "smarter" automations.

in our exmaple in the previous secion, we added some coditions for our nanoleaf based automations. ALL need to be met in this case, but i could easily set it to only one should i want it.
