### What's the difference?

Shortcuts VS Advanced Automations/Shortcut automations
What's the difference?

To simplify things, the terms are going to be a bit more limited. Shortcuts in the shortcuts app in which you tap to run will be called "Shortcuts". Automations made in HomeKit under the "convert to shortcut" option will be called "Advanced Automations"

if you want to learn what a Shortcut can do, head on over to [r/Shortcuts](https://reddit.com/r/Shortcuts). There you can find TONS of suggestions and ideas. You can also post your Shortcuts here if they are HomeKit related :). Basically, Shortcuts are top down workflow automations. They are not necessarily HomeKit related. Advanced Automations however behave a lot like shortcuts with a similar editing method and workflow. The difference however, lies in the fact that Advanced Automations run on your HomeKit Hub rather than an iPhone or iPad. Because of this, Advanced Automations do not get the full set of Shortcuts actions.
