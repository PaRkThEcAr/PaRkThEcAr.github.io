[HomeKit Automation Tips](https://homekitautomationtips.com/â€‹) is a great place to go. its hosted and written by Stefan who is quite knowledgable on some of the fancy trickery :)

For my general networking suggestions, i highly suggest looking at [HomeKit Helper's](https://www.homekithelper.net/networking) guide on the subject as its a good precursory way to assess and address issues.

A lot of people like to SEE automations be made and their applications in video format. For this kind of thing, Most people recomend [Shane Whatley's](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShaneCreates) YouTube channel as he is HomeKit specific. You could also do the [Smart Home Solver's](https://www.youtube.com/c/SmartHomeSolver) YouTube channel, but he is more of a "Jack of All Trades". I found both creators content useful when needing to explain things so you really cant go wrong.
