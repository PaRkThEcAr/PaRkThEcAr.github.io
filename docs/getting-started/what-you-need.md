# What You Need
### Devices/software/etc

What do you need to automate with HomeKit?
Simple!

1. You need a [HomeKit hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208940)! Apple has a page dedicated just to this. You need at least one AppleTV 4th generation or later, a HomePod or HomePod Mini, or an iPad plugged into power with the setting enabled under Settings -> Home -> Use this iPad as a Home Hub
2. You need HomeKit devices. This can be achieved with either native devices (like Hue light bulbs) or bridged accessories with [Homebridge](https://www.homebridge.io), [Scrypted](https://www.scrypted.app/) or [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).
3. An iPhone, iPad, or Mac (running Mojave or later) to edit and create automations. You need an iOS device to use a third party app or do a geofenced automation.
