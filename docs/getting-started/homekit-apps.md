What apps can be used to make an automation in HomeKit?

This can be done a few ways.

1. If you want to use the stock Home app, it has the ability to make simple automations, as well as "Advanced Automations" (AKA Shortcuts Automations). The latter are made similar to iOS shortcuts.
2. You can use the Automation tab in Shortcuts. This will allow you to make regular and Shortcuts Automations as well as on device automations.

The next 3 apps offer control of the HomeKit API and cannot edit the shortcut portion of a shortcut/advanced automation. They can however edit the trigger and conditions with that trigger.

1. [Home+](https://hochgatterer.me/home+/) is a bit pricey (about 15 USD) but very worth it. It offers full automation access within the HomeKit API. It also can serve as a replacement for the native Home app should you want to do that with a full set of customizations.
2. [Eve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eve-for-homekit/id917695792) is a free app made by... Well, Eve. It offers a lot of what Home+ does but not everything. This is a good option if you aren't sure you want to spend the money. Its limitations are that it doesn't give you full API control (though it does quite a bit). It also can give more detailed use metrics for accessories that support it.
4. [Controller](https://controllerforhomekit.com/) offers a lot off what the other two have and it's a good option for those who want to use it. Its advantage is that it is cheaper (considerably) and offers a macOS compliant app :).
